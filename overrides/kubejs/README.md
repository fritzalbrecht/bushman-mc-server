# Sanctuary: Expert Vanilla

Sanctuary is a modpack made to be as streamlined as possible for vanilla players to get into modded, while providing a great experience for modded veterans who are seeking endgame content.

Sanctuary contains a little over 200 mods, with the usual rest being trimmed in favor of quality. 

With Sanctuary, we built the pack with a unique philosophy that had three main goals:

- Provide a foundation for content that is *the best vanilla experience possible*. The game should run extremely smoothly and without bugs, and all annoyances of the vanilla client should be fixed. Sanctuary includes at least 50 performance and bug fix mods that add zero user-facing features.

- Provide great QoL features and lite Vanilla+ content. Things that should be in the base game, that you'll miss the next time you play vanilla. Terralith, Better Strongholds, overhauls of vanilla content that keep the same feel as vanilla while improving the implementation. The pack should be playable as a very lightweight Vanilla+ modpack without the content mods from step 3.

- Provide great hand-picked high-quality content mods to focus questlines and end-game progression around. With the goal being to include as few mods as possible, the bar for Sanctuary was incredibly high. Mods like Create, Mekanism, and Applied Energistics 2 make the cut; others you may be familiar with don't. We hope the curated modlist will help foster creativity in automation without one-block catch all solutions.
